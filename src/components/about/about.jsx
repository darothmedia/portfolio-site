              I am an experienced Software Engineer, Product Manager, and award-winning Creative Producer
              with roots in the Film, TV, and Gaming industries. I love building software that lets kids 
              and adults learn through play. Throughout my career, I have designed, produced, and developed 
              apps & games for major kids entertainment brands: Nickelodeon, Sesame Workshop, PBS, Amazon, 
              and Paramount, among others. I am an experienced web game developer, specializing in PixiJS 
              and Phaser game engines.
              <br />
              <br />
              My work has often been at the cutting edge â€” immersive Augmented Reality apps, voice games 
              for smart speakers, and prototype digital & physical products. I have a keen eye for design 
              and user experience. I am always open to new concepts, fresh inspiration, and good conversation.
              <br />
              <br />
              Throughout my career in media, I have worked with several nonprofits, charities,
              and schools. I currently volunteer with the Children's Media Association,
              a non-profit bringing together the children's media community through
              networking events, mentorship, regional job boards and creative partnerships
              in NYC, LA, and the Bay Area.
              <br />
              <br />
              I am always open to new concepts, fresh inspiration, and good conversation.
              I thrive on creative energy and big ideas.
